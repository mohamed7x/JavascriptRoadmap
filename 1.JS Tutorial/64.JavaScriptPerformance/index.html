<h1>JavaScript Performance</h1>

<p>How to speed up your JavaScript code.</p>

<<h2>Reduce Activity in Loops</h2>
<p>Loops are often used in programming.
<br><br>
Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop.<br><br>

Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster.</p>

<div style="background-color:red;">
  <h3>Bad</h3>
  <pre>
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
</pre>
</div>


<div style="background-color:green;">
  <h3>Better Code:</h3>
  <pre>
let l = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {
</pre>
</div>

<p>The bad code accesses the length property of an array each time the loop is iterated.<br><br>

The better code accesses the length property outside the loop and makes the loop run faster.</p>

<h2>Reduce DOM Access</h2>
<p>Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.
<br><br>
If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
const obj = document.getElementById("demo");
obj.innerHTML = "Hello";
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<div>
<p>If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and the use it as a local variable:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
const obj = document.getElementById("demo");
obj.innerHTML = " Hello";
</script>
</div>

<h2>Reduce DOM Size</h2>
<p>Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.<br><br>

This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page display), especially on smaller devices.<br><br>

Every attempt to search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from a smaller DOM.</p>

<h2>Avoid Unnecessary Variables</h2>

<p>Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.<br><br>

Often you can replace code like this:</p>

<pre>
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;
</pre>
<p>With this:</p>
<pre>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName;
</pre>

<h2>Delay JavaScript Loading</h2>
<p>
Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.<br><br>

While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked.
</p>

<p style="background-color:yellow;">The HTTP specification defines that browsers should not download more than two components in parallel.</p>

<p>An alternative is to use defer="true" in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.<br><br>

If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded:</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
< script>
window.onload = function() {
  const element = document.createElement("script");
  element.src = "myScript.js";
  document.body.appendChild(element);
};
< /script>
</pre>

<h2>Avoid Using with</h2>
<p>Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect on speed. It also clutters up JavaScript scopes.<br><br>

The with keyword is not allowed in strict mode.</p>
