<h1>JavaScript Let</h1>

<form action="../9.JavaScriptConst/index.html">
  <input type="submit" value="Next" />
</form>

<p>
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).<br><br>
Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.<br><br>
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.<br><br>
Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
</p>

<h2>Cannot be Redeclared</h2>
<p>
Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.<br><br>
You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable. <br><br>
With let you can not do this:
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0;

// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared
</pre>

<h3>With var you can:</h3>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
var x = "John Doe";

var x = 0;
</pre>

<h2>Block Scope</h2>
<p>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. <br>
ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. <br>
These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. <br>
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
{
  let x = 2;
} 
// x can NOT be used here
</pre>

<p>
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. <br>
Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
{
  var x = 2;
} 
// x CAN be used here
</pre>

<h2>Redeclaring Variables</h2>
<p>
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems. <br>
Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
var x = 10; 
// Here x is 10

{
var x = 2; 
// Here x is 2 
}

// Here x is 2
</pre>

<p>
Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem. <br>

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
let x = 10; 
// Here x is 10

{ 
let x = 2; 
// Here x is 2 
}

// Here x is 10
</pre>

<h2>Redeclaring</h2>

<p>
Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a program:
</p>

<pre>
var x = 2; 
// Now x is 2 

var x = 3; 
// Now x is 3
</pre>

<p>
With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed:
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
var x = 2;   // Allowed 
let x = 3;   // Not allowed 

{
let x = 2;   // Allowed 
let x = 3;   // Not allowed 
} 

{ 
let x = 2;   // Allowed 
var x = 3;   // Not allowed
}
</pre>

<p>Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed:</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
let x = 2;   // Allowed 

{ 
let x = 3;   // Allowed 
} 

{ 
let x = 4;    // Allowed 
} 
</pre>

<h2>Let Hoisting</h2>
<p>
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time. <br>
Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This is OK:</p>
<pre>
carName = "Volvo"; 
var carName;
</pre>

<p>If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.<br>
Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. <br>
Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:</p>

<pre>
carName = "Saab"; 
let carName = "Volvo";
</pre>

<p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>

<h3>output:</h3>
<div>
  <p id="demo6"></p>
  <script>
  try {
    carName = "Saab";
    let carName = "Volvo";
  }
  catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = err;
  }
  </script>
  
</div>
