<h1>JavaScript Style Guide</h1>

<p>Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Coding Conventions</h2>
<p>Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
  </li>
  <li>
Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
  </li>
  <li>
Programming practices and principles.
  </li>
</ul>

Coding conventions secure quality:

<ul>
  <li>
Improve code readability
  </li>
  <li>
Make code maintenance easier
  </li>
</ul>

Coding conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow, or just be your individual coding practice.
</p>

<p style="background-color: #E2dc89;">
This page describes the general JavaScript code conventions used by W3Schools.
You should also read the next chapter "Best Practices", and learn how to avoid coding pitfalls.
</p>

<h2>Variable Names</h2>
<p>
At W3schools we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).<br><br>

All names start with a letter.<br><br>

At the bottom of this page, you will find a wider discussion about naming rules.
</p>

<pre>
firstName = "John";
lastName = "Doe";

price = 19.90;
tax = 0.20;

fullPrice = price + (price * tax);
</pre>

<h2>
Spaces Around Operators
</h2>
<p>
Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
let x = y + z;
const myArray = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];
</pre>

<h2>Code Indentation</h2>
<p>
Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks:
</p>

<h3>Functions:</h3>

<pre>
  function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
</pre>

<p style="background-color:#ff9999;">
Do not use tabs (tabulators) for indentation. Different editors interpret tabs differently.
</p>

<h2>Statement Rules</h2>
<p>
General rules for simple statements:

<ul>
<li>
Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Exampke:</h3>
<pre>
const cars = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
</pre>

<p>
General rules for complex (compound) statements:
<ul>
  <li>Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.</li>
  <li>Use one space before the opening bracket.</li>
  <li>Put the closing bracket on a new line,</li>
  <li>Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Functions:</h3>
<pre>
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
</pre>

<h3>Loops:</h3>
<pre>
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  x += i;
}
</pre>

<h3>Conditionals:</h3>
<pre>
if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
</pre>

<h2>Object Rules</h2>
<p>
General rules for object definitions:
<ul>
  <li>
Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
  </li>
 <li>
Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
  </li>
 <li>
Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
  </li>
 <li>
Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
  </li>
 <li>
Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
  </li>
 <li>
Always end an object definition with a semicolon.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
</pre>

<p>Short objects can be written compressed, on one line, using spaces only between properties, like this:
</p>

<pre>
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
</pre>


<h2>Line Length < 80</h2>
<p>
For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters.<br><br>

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly.";
</pre>

<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>
Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:
<ul>
  <li>Variable and function names written as <b>camelCase</b></li>
  <li>Global variables written in 
  <b>UPPERCASE</b> (We don't, but it's quite common)</li>
  <li>Constants (like PI) written in <b>UPPERCASE</b></li>
</ul>
Should you use <b>hyp-hens</b>, <b>camelCase</b>, or <b>under_scores</b> in variable names?<br><br>

This is a question programmers often discuss. The answer depends on who you ask:<br><br>

<h4>Hyphens (-) in HTML and CSS:</h4>
<style>
  img {
    width: 400px;
    height: 200px;
  }
</style>
<img src = "https://www.scientific-editing.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/where-to-use-a-hyphen-768x432.jpg"></img>

HTML5 attributes can start with data- (data-quantity, data-price).<br><br>

CSS uses hyphens in property-names (font-size)
</p>
<p style="background-color:#ff9999;">
Hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names.
</p>

<h4>Underscores:</h4>

<p>
Many programmers prefer to use underscores (date_of_birth), especially in SQL databases.
</p>

<p>
Underscores are often used in PHP documentation.
</p>

<h4>PascalCase:</h4>

PascalCase is often preferred by C programmers.

<h4>camelCase:</h4>

<p>
camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ff9999;">
Do not start names with a $ sign. It will put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names.
</p>

<h2>Loading JavaScript in HTML</h2>

<p>
Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):
</p>

<code>
<script src="myscript.js"></script>
</code>

<h2>Accessing HTML Elements</h2>

<p>
A consequence of using "untidy" HTML styles, might result in JavaScript errors.<br>

These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:
</p>

<pre>
const obj = getElementById("Demo")

const obj = getElementById("demo")
</pre>

<p>
If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML.
</p>

<h2>File Extensions</h2>
<p>
HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).<br><br>

CSS files should have a .css extension.<br><br>

JavaScript files should have a .js extension.
</p>

<h2>Use Lower Case File Names</h2>

<p>
Most web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names:<br><br>

london.jpg cannot be accessed as London.jpg.<br><br>

Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive:<br><br>

london.jpg can be accessed as London.jpg or london.jpg.<br><br>

If you use a mix of upper and lower case, you have to be extremely consistent.<br><br>

If you move from a case insensitive, to a case sensitive server, even small errors can break your web site.<br><br>

To avoid these problems, always use lower case file names (if possible).
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>
Coding conventions are not used by computers. Most rules have little impact on the execution of programs.<br><br>

Indentation and extra spaces are not significant in small scripts.<br><br>

For code in development, readability should be preferred. Larger production scripts should be minimized.
