<h2>
Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
</h2>
<p>

In real life, a car is an object.<br>

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop: <br>
<img src="objectExplained.gif">
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
<br>

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

</p>
<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
<p>
You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
<br>
This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
</p>
<code>
let car = "Fiat";
</code>
<p>
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. <br>

This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
</p>
<code>
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
</code>
<p>
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
</p>
<h3>Output: the type of car</h3>
<div>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Display some data from the object:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is " + car.type;
</script>

</div>

<p>
  <strong>Nots:</strong>
It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword. <br>

Learn more about using const with objects in the chapter: JS Const.
</p>

<h2>Object Definition</h2>
<p>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<code>
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
</code>
<p>
Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:
</p>

<h2>Object Properties</h2>
<p>
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Property Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>firstName</td>
    <td>John</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lastName</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>age</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>eyeColor</td>
    <td>blue</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Accessing Object Properties</h2>
	<p>You can access object properties in two ways:</p>
	
	<code>
objectName.propertyName
	</code>
	or
	<code>
objectName["propertyName"]
	</code>
	<p> <strong>Nots:</strong>
JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
Object Methods
	</h2>
	
	<p>
Objects can also have methods. <br>

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. <br>

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
	</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Property Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>firstName</td>
    <td>John</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lastName</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>age</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>eyeColor</td>
    <td>blue</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fullName</td>
    <td>function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
	<p><strong>Nots:</strong>
A method is a function stored as a property.	</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<code>
const person = { <br>
  firstName: "John", <br>
  lastName : "Doe", <br>
  id       : 5566, <br>
  fullName : function() { <br>
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; <br>
  } <br>
};
	</code>
	
	<p>
In the example above, <strong>this</strong>  refers to the person object. <br>

I.E. <strong>this.firstName</strong> means the firstName property of <b>this</b>. <br>

I.E. <b>this.firstName</b> means the firstName property of <b>person</b>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What is "this"?</h2>
	<p>
In JavaScript, the "this" keyword refers to an object. <br>

Which object depends on how "this" is being invoked (used or called).<br>

The "this" keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
	</p>
	
	<p>
In an object method, <b>this</b> refers to the object. <br><br>
Alone, <b>this</b> refers to the global object. <br><br>
In a function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object. <br><br>
In a function, in strict mode, <b>this</b> is undefined. <br><br>
In an event, <b>this</b> refers to the element that received the event.<br><br>
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer <b>this</b> to any object.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> <b>this</b> is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of <b>this</b>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The "this" Keyword</h2>
	<p>In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.<br><br>

In the example above, "this" is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
<br><br>
In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Accessing Object Methods</h2>
	<p>You access an object method with the following syntax:	</p>
	
	<code>objectName.methodName()</code>
	
	<h3>Example</h3>
	<code>name = person.fullName();</code>
<h3>Output:</h3>

<div>
<p>An object method is a function definition, stored as a property value.</p>

<p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>
</div>
	
	
	
<p>If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition: </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<code>
Example
name = person.fullName;
</code>
	<h3>Output:</h3>
	<div>
 <p>If you access an object method without (), it will return the function definition: </p>
<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const person2 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     : 5566,
fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = person2.fullName;
</script>
	</div>
	
	<h2>
Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
	</h2>
	<p>When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:</p>
	
	<code>
x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object <br>
y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object <br>
z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
	</code>
	
	<p>
	  <b>Note:</b>
Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
	</p>
