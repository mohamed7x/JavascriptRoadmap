<h1>JavaScript Syntax</h1>

<p>
JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:
</p>
<code>
// How to create variables: <br>
var x;
let y;
<br>
// How to use variables:<br>
x = 5;
y = 6;
</code>

<h2>JavaScript Values</h2>
<p>
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
<ul>
  <li>Fixed values</li>
  <li>Variable values</li>
</ul>

Fixed values are called <strong>Literals</strong>.
<br>
Variable values are called <strong>Variables</strong> .
</p>

<h3>1.JavaScript Literals</h3>
<p>
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
<br><br>
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
<br>
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
</p>

<h3>2.JavaScript Variables</h3>
<p>
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.<br>
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.<br>
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.<br><br>
In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

<code>
 <br>
let x; 
<br>
x = 6;
</code>
</p>

<h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
<p>
- JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
<br>
- JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:
</p>

<h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>
<p>
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.<br>
The computation is called an evaluation.<br>
For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:<br>
Expressions can also contain variable values,For example: x * 10<br>
The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.<br>
For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":

</p>

<h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>

<p>
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables: <br>
The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables: <br>
In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result.

</p>
<code>
let x, y; <br>
x = 5 + 6;<br>
y = x * 10;<br>
</code>

<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
<p>
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
<br>
Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
<br>
Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:<br>
</p>
<code>
let x = 5;   // I will be executed
<br>
// x = 6;   I will NOT be executed
</code>
<h2>
JavaScript Identifiers / Names
</h2>
<p>
Identifiers are JavaScript names.
<br><br>
Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
<br><br>
The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
<br><br>
A JavaScript name must begin with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
A letter (A-Z or a-z)
  </li>
  <li>
A dollar sign ($)
  </li>
  <li>
Or an underscore (_)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
<br> 
<strong>
Note:
</strong>
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.
<br><br>
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
</p>
<h2>
JavaScript is Case Sensitive
</h2>
<p>
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
<br>
The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:
  <br><br>
JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.
<br><br>
Hyphens (first-name, last-name, master-card) are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
  
</p>
<p>
Lower Camel Case:
<br>
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
<br>
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
