<h1>JavaScript Debugging</h1>
<p>
Errors can (will) happen, every time you write some new computer code.
</p>

<h2>Code Debugging</h2>
<p>
Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. <br><br>

Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.<br><br>

Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.<br><br>

Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.
</p>

<h2>JavaScript Debuggers</h2>
<p>
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.<br><br>

Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.
<br><br>
With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.<br><br>

Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
</p>

<h2>The console.log() Method</h2>
<p>
If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window:
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
< !DOCTYPE html>
< html>
< body>

< h1>My First Web Page</h1>

< script>
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
console.log(c);
< /script>

< /body>
< /html>
</pre>

<h3>Output:</h3>
<div>
<h2>My First Web Page</h2>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.</p>
<script>
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
console.log(c);
</script>
</div>

<p>
Tip: Read more about the console.log() method in our JavaScript Console Reference.
</p>

<h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>
<p>
In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.<br><br>

At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.<br><br>

After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
</p>

<h2>
The debugger Keyword
</h2>
<p>
The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.<br><br>

This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.<br><br>

If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.<br><br>

With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
let x = 15 * 5;
debugger;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</pre>
<<h3>Output:</h3>
<div>
<p id="demo"></p>

<p>With the debugger turned on, the code below should stop executing before it executes the third line.</p>

<script>
let x = 15 * 5;
debugger;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>
</div>

<h2>Major Browsers' Debugging Tools</h2>

<p>
Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.<br><br>

Otherwise follow these steps
</p>

<h3>Chrome</h3>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>Open the browser.</li>
    <li>From the menu, select "More tools".
    </li>
    <li>From tools, choose "Developer tools".</li>
    <li>Finally, select Console.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Firefox</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the browser.</li>
    <li>From the menu, select "Web Developer".</li>
    <li>Finally, select "Web Console".</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Edge</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the browser.</li>
    <li>From the menu, select "Developer Tools".</li>
    <li>Finally, select "Console".</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Opera</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the browser.</li>
    <li>From the menu, select "Developer".
    </li>
    <li>From "Developer", select "Developer tools".</li>
    <li>Finally, select "Console".</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
<p>
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.<br><br>
The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics.
