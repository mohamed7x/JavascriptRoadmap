  <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

  <form action="../5.JavaScriptSyntax/index.html">
    <input type="submit" value="next" />
  </form>

  <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>
  <h3>
    Example
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>let x, y, z; // Statement 1</li>
    <li>x = 5; // Statement 2</li>
    <li>y = 6; // Statement 3</li>
    <li>z = x + y; // Statement 4</li>
  </ul>

  <p id="demo"></p>

  <script>
    let x, y, z;  // Statement 1
    x = 5;        // Statement 2
    y = 6;        // Statement 3
    z = x + y;    // Statement 4

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
      "The value of z is " + z + ".";  
  </script>
  <h2>JavaScript Programs</h2>

  <p>
    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. <br><br>

    In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. <br><br>

    A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.<br><br>

    In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Semicolons ;</h2>
  <p>
    Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.<br>

    Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
  </p>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <div>
    let a, b, c; // Declare 3 variables
  
    a = 5; // Assign the value 5 to a
  
    b = 6; // Assign the value 6 to b
 
    c = a + b; // Assign the sum of a and b to c
  </div>

  <p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>

  <p id="demo1"></p>
  <script>
    let a, b, c;
    a = 5;
    b = 6;
    c = a + b;
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;
  </script>
  <p>
    When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
    <br>
    a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
  </p>
  <h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.<br>
    The following lines are equivalent:<br>
    let person = "Hege";<br>
    let person="Hege";<br>
    A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
  </p>
  <h2>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h2>
  <p>
    For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.<br>
    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: ( = + - * / )
    <br>

  </p>
  <div>
    Example
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Hello Dolly!";
  </div>
  <h2>JavaScript Code Blocks</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

    The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

    One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
  </p>

  <div>Example <br>
    <code>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
</code>
    <br><br>
    we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks
  </div>

  <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
    <br>
    Our <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp">
      Reserved Words Reference
    </a> lists all JavaScript keywords.
    <br>
    Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:
    <br>
    <strong>note:</strong>
    In JavaScript you cannot use these reserved words as variables, labels, or function names:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Keyword</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>var</td>
      <td>Declares a variable</td>

    <tr>
      <td>let</td>
      <td>Declares a block variable</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>const</td>
      <td>Declares a block constant</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>if</td>
      <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>switch</td>
      <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>for</td>
      <td>Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>function</td>
      <td>Declares a function</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>return</td>
      <td>Exits a function</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>try</td>
      <td>Implements error handling to a block of statements</td>
    </tr>

  </table>

    JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
