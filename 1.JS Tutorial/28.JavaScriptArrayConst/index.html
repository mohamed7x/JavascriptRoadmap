<h1>JavaScript Array Const</h1>

<form action="../JavaScriptDateObjects/index.html">

<p>
In 2015, JavaScript introduced an important new keyword: const.<br>

It has become a common practice to declare arrays using const:
</p>

<code>
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
</code>

<h2>Cannot be Reassigned</h2>

<p>
An array declared with const cannot be reassigned:
</p>

<code>
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
</code>

<h2>Arrays are Not Constants</h2>
<p>

The keyword const is a little misleading.
<br>
It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.
<br>
Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.
</p>

<h2>Elements Can be Reassigned</h2>
<p>
You can change the elements of a constant array:

</p>
<code>
Example
// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
</code>

<h2>Assigned when Declared</h2>

<p>
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:<br>

Meaning: An array declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.<br>

Using const without initializing the array is a syntax error:
</p>

<code>
Example
This will not work:

const cars;
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
</code>

<p>
Arrays declared with var can be initialized at any time.<br>

You can even use the array before it is declared:

</p>

<code>
Example
This is OK:

cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
var cars;
</code>

<h2>
Const Block Scope
</h2>
<p>
An array declared with const has Block Scope.<br>

An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block:
</p>

<code>
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
</code>

<p>
An array declared with var does not have block scope:
</p>
<code>


Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
</code>

<h2>
Redeclaring Arrays
</h2>
<p>
Redeclaring an array declared with var is allowed anywhere in a program:
</p>
<code>
Example
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed
</code>

<p>
Redeclaring or reassigning an array to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:
</p>

<code>
Example
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
{
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
}
</code>

<p>
Redeclaring or reassigning an existing const array, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:
</p>

<code>
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Not allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];         // Not allowed

{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
  cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];       // Not allowed
}
</code>

<p>
Redeclaring an array with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:
</p>
<code>
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
</code>
