  <p>
    4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using <span style="color: red;">var</span></li>
    <li>Using <span style="color: red;">let</span></li>
    <li>Using <span style="color: red;">const</span></li>
    <li>Using nothing</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
  <p>
    Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).<br><br>
    In this example, <span style="color: red;">x</span>, <span style="color: red;">y</span>, and <span
      style="color: red;">z</span>, are variables, declared with the <span style="color: red;">var</span> keyword:
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre>
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
</pre>

  <h3>output</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>
    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <script>
      var x = 5;
      var y = 6;
      var z = x + y;
      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
        "The value of z is: " + z;
    </script>

  </div>

  <p>In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
  let x = 5;
  let y = 6;
  let z = x + y;
</pre>


  <p>In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
  x = 5;
  y = 6;
  z = x + y;
</pre>

<p>
  From all the examples above, you can guess:
<ul>
  <li>x stores the value 5</li>
  <li>y stores the value 6</li>
  <li>z stores the value 11</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <h2>When to Use JavaScript var?</h2>
  Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, or const.<br>
  The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.<br>
  The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.<br>
  If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
</div>


<h2>When to Use JavaScript const?</h2>
<p>
  If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.<br><br>
  If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.<br><br>
  In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
</pre>

<p>
  The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.<br><br>
  These are constant values and cannot be changed.<br><br>
  The variable total is declared with the let keyword.<br><br>
  This is a value that can be changed.
</p>

<h2>Just Like Algebra</h2>
<p>Just like in algebra, variables hold values:</p>
<pre>
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
</pre>

<p>Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions: </p>
<pre>
let z = x + y;
</pre>
<p>From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11.</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><strong>note:</strong>
  Variables are containers for storing values.
</p>


<h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
<p>
  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.<br><br>

  These unique names are called identifiers.<br><br>
  Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).<br><br>
  The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
  <li>Names must begin with a letter</li>
  <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)</li>
  <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)</li>
  <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
</ul>

<p style="background-color: #ffffcc;"><b>Note:</b>
  JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.</p>




<h2>The Assignment Operator</h2>
  <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.<br><br>

    This is different from algebra.<br>
    The following does not make sense in algebra:
  </p>

  <pre>
x = x + 5
 </pre>

  <p>
    In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.<br>
    (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)
  </p>

  <p style="background-color: #ffffcc;"><strong>Note:</strong><br>
    The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
  </p>


  <h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".<br><br>
    In programming, text values are called text strings.<br><br>
    JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.<br><br>
    Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.<br><br>
    If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';
</pre>

<h2>Declaring a JavaScript Variable</h2>
<p>
  Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.<br>
  You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:
</p>
<pre>
var carName;
</pre>
 <p>or:</p>
<pre>
let carName;
</pre>

<p>
  After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).<br>
  To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
</p>
<pre>
carName = "Volvo";
</pre>

<p>
  You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
</p>
<pre>
let carName = "Volvo";
</pre>

<p>
  In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.<br><br>
  Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
  &lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    let carName = "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>output</h3>
  <div>
  <p id="demo2"></p>

  <script>
  let carName = "Volvo";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = carName;
  </script>
  </div>

  <p style="background-color: #ffffcc;"><b>Note:</b>
    It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.</p>

    <h2>One Statement, Many Variables</h2>
    <p>
      You can declare many variables in one statement.<br>
      Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
  let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
   </pre>
   <p>A declaration can span multiple lines:</p>
<pre>
let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
</pre>

<h2>Value = undefined</h2>
  <p>
    In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be
    calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.<br><br>

    A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.<br><br>

    The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
  </p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre>
let carName;
 </pre>
  <h3>output</h3>
  <div>
  <p id="demo3"></p>
  <script>
  let carName2;
  document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = carName2;
  </script>
  </div>
 
  <h2>Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables</h2>
  <p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
  
    The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:</p>
  
  <h3>Example</h3>
  
  <pre>
    var carName = "Volvo";
    var carName;
  </pre>
  <h3>Output</h3>
  <div>
  <p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.</p>

<p id="demo33"></p>

<script>
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
document.getElementById("demo33").innerHTML = carName;
</script>
  </div>

  <p style="background-color:#ffffcc;"><strong>Note:</strong>
    You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const. <br>

    This will not work:
    <pre style="background-color: red;">
let carName = "Volvo";
let carName;
    </pre>
  </p>

  <h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
  <p>
    As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:
  </p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre>
let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
 </pre>
  <p>
    You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:
  </p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre>
let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
 </pre>

 <h3>Also try this:</h3>

  <pre>
let x = "5" + 2 + 3;
 </pre>
  <h3>output:</h3>
  <div>
    <p id="demo4"></p>

  <script>
let w = "5" + 2 + 3;
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = w;
    </script>
  </div>

  <p style="background-color: #ffffcc;"><strong>Note:</strong>
    If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
  </p>

  <h3>Now try this:</h3>
<pre>
let x = 2 + 3 + "5";
</pre>
  <h3>output:</h3>

  <div>
    <p id="demo5"></p>
    <script>
let v = 2 + 3 + "5";
document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = v;
    </script>
  </div>

  <h2>JavaScript Dollar Sign $</h2>
  <p>Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:</p>

<pre>
let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>
<div>
  <p>The dollar sign is treated as a letter in JavaScript names.</p>

<p id="demo44"></p>

<script>
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
document.getElementById("demo44").innerHTML = $$$ + $myMoney;
</script>
</div>

<p>Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an 
  alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

  In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements.
   In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".</p>

<h2>JavaScript Underscore (_)</h2>
<p>Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
let _lastName = "Johnson";
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
</pre>

<p>Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers 
  is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.</p>
