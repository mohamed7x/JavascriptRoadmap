<h1>JavaScript Use Strict</h1>

<p>"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".</p>

<h2>The "use strict" Directive</h2>

<p>
The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.<br><br>

It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.<br><br>

The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".<br><br>

With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.<br><br>

All modern browsers support "use strict" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower:
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.<br><br>

"use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.
</p>

<h2>Declaring Strict Mode</h2>
<p>
Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.

Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode):
</p>

<h3>example 1</h3>
<pre>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;       
// This will cause an error because x is not declared
</pre>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<pre>
"use strict";
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  y = 3.14;   
  // This will also cause an error because y is not declared
}
</pre>

<h3>Output:</h3>
<div>
<h2>With "use strict":</h2>
<h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>
<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;  
// This will cause an error (x is not defined).

myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  y = 3.14;   
  // This will cause an error (y is not defined)
}
</script>
</div>

<p>
Declared inside a function, it has local scope (only the code inside the function is in strict mode):
</p>

<pre>
x = 3.14;      
// This will not cause an error.
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  y = 3.14;   
  // This will cause an error
}
</pre>

<h3>Output:</h3>
<div>
<p>"use strict" in a function will only cause errors in that function.</p>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>
<script>
x1 = 3.14;    
// This will not cause an error.
myFunction1();

function myFunction1() {
  "use strict";
  y1 = 3.14;  
// This will cause an error (y is not defined).
}
</script>
</div>

<h2>The "use strict"; Syntax</h2>
<p>
The syntax, for declaring strict mode, was designed to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript.

Compiling a numeric literal (4 + 5;) or a string literal ("John Doe";) in a JavaScript program has no side effects. It simply compiles to a non existing variable and dies.

So "use strict"; only matters to new compilers that "understand" the meaning of it.
</p>

<h2>Why Strict Mode?</h2>
<p>
Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.

As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.

In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.

In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.
</p>

<h2>Not Allowed in Strict Mode</h2>

<p>Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;                
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b>Objects are variables too.
</p>

<p>Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
x = {p1:10, p2:20};     
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let x = 3.14;
delete x;              
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Deleting a function is not allowed.</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
function x(p1, p2) {};
delete x;               
// This will cause an error 
</pre>

<p>Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
function x(p1, p1) {};  
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let x = 010;          
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Octal escape characters are not allowed:
</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let x = "\010";          
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
const obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", {value:0, writable:false});

obj.x = 3.14;          
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Writing to a get-only property is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
const obj = {get x() {return 0} };

obj.x = 3.14;          
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
delete Object.prototype; 
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>The word eval cannot be used as a variable:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let eval = 3.14;        
// This will cause an error
</pre>


<p>The word arguments cannot be used as a variable:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let arguments = 3.14;   
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>The with statement is not allowed:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
with (Math){x = cos(2)};
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>For security reasons, eval() is not allowed to create variables in the scope from which it was called.<br>
In strict mode, a variable can not be used before it is declared:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
eval ("x = 2");
alert (x);      
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>In strict mode, eval() can not declare a variable using the var keyword:</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
eval ("var x = 2");
alert (x);   
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>eval() can not declare a variable using the let keyword:</p>
<pre>
eval ("let x = 2");
alert (x);       
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<p>The <b>this</b> keyword in functions behaves differently in strict mode.<br>

The this keyword refers to the object that called the function.<br><br>

If the object is not specified, functions in strict mode will return undefined and functions in normal mode will return the global object (window):</p>
<pre>
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  alert(this);
  // will alert "undefined"
}
myFunction();
</pre>

<h2>Future Proof!</h2>
<p>
Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.

These are:
<ul>
  <li>implements</li>
  <li>interface</li>
  <li>let</li>
  <li>package</li>
  <li>private</li>
  <li>protected</li>
  <li>public</li>
  <li>static</li>
  <li>yield</li>
</ul></p>
<pre>
"use strict";
let public = 1500;    
// This will cause an error
</pre>

<h2>Watch Out!</h2>
<p>The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
